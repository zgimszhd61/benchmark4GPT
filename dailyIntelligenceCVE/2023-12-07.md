The n8n framework, specifically version 0.218.0 for Node.js, has been identified with several CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) vulnerabilities:

CVE-2023-27563: This vulnerability is classified as 'High' with a CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score of 8.8. It allows for Escalation of Privileges, where an attacker could potentially gain higher access levels than intended​​​​.

CVE-2023-27564: Also classified as 'High', with a CVSS score of 7.5, this vulnerability allows for Information Disclosure. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information​​.

CVE-2023-27562: With a 'Medium' severity rating and a CVSS score of 6.5, this vulnerability involves Directory Traversal, which could allow an attacker to access directories and files stored outside the web root folder​​.

RCE:

CVE-2023-49093: This vulnerability was found in HtmlUnit, a GUI-less browser for Java programs. It was susceptible to RCE via XSTL when browsing a malicious webpage. The issue has been patched in version 3.9.0 of HtmlUnit. The severity of this vulnerability was critical, with a CVSS score of 9.8 by GitHub, Inc., though NVD had not provided a score at the time of analysis​​.

CVE-2023-21930: This vulnerability affected Oracle Java SE and Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition products, particularly the JSSE component. It was an easily exploitable issue that allowed unauthenticated attackers with network access via DTLS to compromise the software. The vulnerability impacted versions 11.0.17, 17.0.5, 19.0.1 of Oracle Java SE and versions 20.3.8, 21.3.4, and 22.3.0 of Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. It had a CVSS score of 5.3, indicating medium severity​​.

CVE-2023-21835: This vulnerability was also found in Oracle Java SE and Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition, impacting the same versions as mentioned in CVE-2023-21930. It allowed unauthenticated attackers to cause a partial denial of service (DOS) of the affected software. This vulnerability was rated with a CVSS score of 5.3, indicating a medium level of severity​​.

CVE-2023-22515: Identified in Atlassian Confluence Data Center and Server, this critical vulnerability allowed remote attackers to create unauthorized Confluence administrator accounts. It affected multiple versions of Confluence and was rated with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating a high level of severity. Atlassian released a fix to address this issue​​.

CVE-2023-46214: This vulnerability was found in Splunk Enterprise, where the software did not safely sanitize extensible stylesheet language transformations (XSLT) provided by users. This could lead to remote code execution on the Splunk Enterprise instance. Versions below 9.0.7 and 9.1.2 of Splunk Enterprise were affected. The CVSS score for this vulnerability was 8.8​​.

CVE-2023-37895: A Java object deserialization issue was found in Jackrabbit webapp/standalone, allowing attackers to remotely execute code via RMI. Versions up to 2.20.10 (stable branch) and 2.21.17 (unstable branch) were affected. Users were advised to update to versions 2.20.11 or 2.21.18​​.


XXE:

CVE-2023-41034: This vulnerability is found in the Eclipse Leshan project, a Java implementation for device management servers and clients. The affected components, DDFFileParser and DefaultDDFFileValidator in Eclipse Leshan, were susceptible to XXE attacks. This vulnerability was critical, with a CVSS score of 9.8 according to NVD and 6.5 according to GitHub, Inc. The vulnerability was addressed through patches and mitigation strategies provided by GitHub.

CVE-2023-3276: This vulnerability was identified in Dromara HuTool up to version 5.8.19. The specific issue was in the readBySax function of the XmlUtil.java file, part of the XML Parsing Module, leading to XML external entity reference issues. The NVD rated this as a high severity vulnerability with a CVSS score of 7.5, while VulDB rated it as medium severity with a score of 5.5.

These vulnerabilities are significant as they highlight the ongoing challenges in securing Java applications against XXE attacks, which can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or even remote code execution. It's crucial for developers and administrators to stay updated with the latest patches and security advisories to mitigate these risks.
