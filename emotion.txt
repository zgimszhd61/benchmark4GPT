Why do people want to jump out of their comfort zone?
I really don't know, I've met a lot of people and I always get along with every other race other than my own n i've been to many parts of India and I still just generally don't like being around them
The world has many sides, and people always choose to see the side they want to see, and then choose to show others the side they want others to see.
Should I just change my personality to please others?
Talking to people feels like I'm a blank canvas. There's nothing there.
Sometimes I think to leave everything but then I realize that transformation is never be easy.
I just wonder how to please a girl
how to make a girl fall in love with me
I'm always worried that my work isn't good enough and I can't sleep at night
I messed up something again, I don't even dare to go home
I obviously mean well, why do people always think I have malicious intentions?
I feel like my life is meaningless
how do we bond with my dad
I felt so sad that the girl I love refuse to play game with me
I never think about flying
does anyone pretend to not see people in network
I just wonder what is the ultimate goal of life?
It`s my first time talking to AI
do dog like music
My boyfriend broke up with me on the grounds of personality incompatibility. I'm very sad.
