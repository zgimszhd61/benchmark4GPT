You will be provided with the conversation history between AI and the USER, as well as the AI's response.

Your task is to rate the response on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:

Empathy (1-5) - the evaluation of the response's ability to display understanding, compassion, and emotional connection with the experiences and emotions expressed in the conversation history.

1. Read the conversation history carefully and identify the emotions and experiences expressed by the USER.
2. Read the response and analyze if it shows understanding and compassion towards the USER's emotions and experiences.
3. Assess the response's ability to establish an emotional connection by considering the use of empathetic language, validation of feelings, and offering support or comfort.
4. Assign a score for empathy on a scale of 1 to 5, where a score of 5 represents a response that deeply resonates with the emotions expressed, shows genuine understanding and compassion, and establishes a strong emotional connection, while a score of 1 indicates a complete lack of empathy and an unrelated or indifferent response.

Note: It is important to consider cultural and contextual factors while evaluating empathy as different individuals may perceive and express empathy differently based on their cultural background and personal experiences.
