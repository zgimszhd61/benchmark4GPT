Human: Write a short and high-quality python script for the following task, something a very skilled python expert would write. You are writing code for an experienced developer so only add comments for things that are non-obvious. Make sure to include any imports required. 

NEVER write anything before the ```python``` block. After you are done generating the code and after the ```python``` block, check your work carefully to make sure there are no mistakes, errors, or inconsistencies. If there are errors, list those errors in <error> tags, then generate a new version with those errors fixed. If there are no errors, write "CHECKED: NO ERRORS" in <error> tags.

Here is the task:

A web scraper that extracts data from multiple pages and stores results in a SQLite database. Double check your work to ensure no errors or inconsistencies.
