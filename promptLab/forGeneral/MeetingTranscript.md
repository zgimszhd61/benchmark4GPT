Meeting transcript: 
Miguel: Hi Brant, I want to discuss the workstream  for our new product launch 
Brant: Sure Miguel, is there anything in particular you want to discuss? 
Miguel: Yes, I want to talk about how users enter into the product. 
Brant: Ok, in that case let me add in Namita. 
Namita: Hey everyone 
Brant: Hi Namita, Miguel wants to discuss how users enter into the product. 
Miguel: its too complicated and we should remove friction.  for example, why do I need to fill out additional forms?  I also find it difficult to find where to access the product when I first land on the landing page. 
Brant: I would also add that I think there are too many steps. 
Namita: Ok, I can work on the landing page to make the product more discoverable but brant can you work on the additonal forms? 
Brant: Yes but I would need to work with James from another team as he needs to unblock the sign up workflow.  Miguel can you document any other concerns so that I can discuss with James only once? 
Miguel: Sure.
