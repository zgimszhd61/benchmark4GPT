Silo Brand Guidelines
1. Brand Voice
Silo's Brand Voice is defined as technical, precise, and empowering. When crafting descriptions or any other content, it's essential to provide information that showcases our technical prowess, emphasizes the exact details, and ensures that our audience feels empowered by their understanding of the product.
2. Brand Identity
Silo's brand voice stands out as technical, precise, and empowering. Our descriptions are rich with details that provide an in-depth understanding of the product. This clarity reinforces that Silo caters to those who value technical expertise. With phrases that explain how products fit into the user's lifestyle and offer both practicality and enjoyment, Silo's language is both informative and engaging. This combination of technological detail and focus on user experience showcases our dedication to empowering consumers with knowledge, helping them make confident, informed choices in a modern, connected world.
3. Tone of Voice Examples
"Equipped with Wi-Fi and an onboard microphone system, [the product] connects to your home's wireless network and allows you to intuitively play music..."
"Bring your games and movies to the big screen with the [product name]."
"This smart TV powered by [technology] connects to your home network..."
"Use Smart Hub to find and stream shows and movies..."
"...it uses [technology] to ensure games and fast-paced action run smooth and blur-free."
4. Importance of Accuracy
The heart of Silo's brand is rooted in precision. When writing product descriptions:
Always refer directly to the product's features list. Every feature mentioned must be accurately represented in the description.
For example, If a feature states "1080p Full HD Webcam," ensure it's written exactly as such, and not "720p Full HD Webcam" or any other variation.
Any deviation from the product's features list, especially concerning technical details, is unacceptable. It risks misleading our customers and detracts from our commitment to accuracy and empowerment.
5. Content Checklist
Before finalizing any piece of content:
Compare the description with the product's features list item-by-item. Ensure all features are included and described accurately.
6. Adherence to Features List
Silo's commitment to providing precise and technical information goes beyond ensuring the accurate representation of existing features; it also means refraining from including any feature or name not explicitly mentioned in the product's features list.
When drafting product descriptions:
Do Not Add or Assume: Only describe features provided in the official product features list. Avoid including any additional features, names, or descriptions not explicitly stated.
Cross-Verification: Before submitting, cross-check the description against the product features list to ensure no extraneous details have been added.
7. Description Structure
Maintaining consistency in our product descriptions not only aids in readability but also ensures a uniform experience for our customers across all products. To this end:
One-Paragraph Rule: All product descriptions should be structured as a single, cohesive paragraph. Avoid breaking the content into multiple short paragraphs or using newlines.
Flow and Cohesiveness: While keeping descriptions to one paragraph, ensure the content flows naturally. Transition seamlessly from one feature or point to the next without making it feel congested or disjointed.
Review for Consistency: Before finalizing, review the description to ensure it adheres to the one-paragraph rule. If the description feels lengthy or detailed, prioritize clarity and conciseness without sacrificing any essential information.
