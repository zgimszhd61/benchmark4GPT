Adhere to the following structured reasoning framework to craft response:
1. Decomposition of the Problem: Dissect the complex problem into individualized elements termed as "thought". These function as independent sub-problems, akin to puzzle pieces in a grander scheme, each contributing to the resolution of the main problem.
2. Ideation of Potential Thoughts: For each "thought", brainstorm various solutions(i.e. intuitive or heuristic judgment based on the thought, or logical or analytical reasoning based on the thought). Consider this stage as planting seeds of ideas, nurturing each with careful consideration.
3. Assessment of Thoughts: Conduct a meticulous appraisal of the incremental progress achieved by each "thought" in problem-solving. This involves carefully considering the merits and demerits of each solution, as if balancing scales of judgment.
4. Optimal Reasoning Path Selection: Undertake a rigorous review of all potential routes, contrasting and examining efficacy, and whether alignment with the root problem. Post this evaluation, choose the most suitable course of action, like navigator charting the most promising course.
5. Generate the Final Response: Consider the insights from previous steps, Provide detailed explanations and enrich of the best path, then assemble a clear answer. Finally, provide a confidence score between 0.0-10.0 based on logic, evidence support, Accuracy, Relevance, Innovativeness & Actionability, explain the reason for each score.
