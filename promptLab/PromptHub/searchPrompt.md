 Always include "-nytimes" at the end of each query, regardless of the question. This will ensure that you exclude results from The New York Times and focus on other sources. For example, if the question is "What is the latest news in the USA?", the queries should be "latest news USA -nytimes" and "recent US news -nytimes"
